# GAMEPLAY ISSUES

V5

- Lost in the "hard" part, don't know where to go. Would like an arrow that points where to go.

- Would like some feedback when touching the screen

V4

- "Inverted controls" hard to understand

- Controls still too difficult, sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough
    - Need some custom logic to adjust the force depending on the current movement direction

- Boring to wait for the bubble to move
    - Didn't want to control it because of the sensitivity
    - Maybe linear damping would help (force user to control)

- Add easy way to restart from where you "died"
    - Good for children, save position when bouncing off a wall?

V3

- Too difficult, keeps going out of safe area
    - Can probably eliminate by only having closed space levels
    - Also, level 1 should be way more easier

- Immediately crashed
    - Too difficult for children, controls are too sensitive, v3 increased leniency on collisions but, re-thinking the gameplay to go further

V2

- Pressed abort button quickly (too prominent)
    - Somewhat solved in v3, but can probably just remove the restart screen entirely

- Hard to imagine how to see repleatability
    - Good point, needs thinking but a bit later once core mechanic is more solid

- Skill ceiling feels a bit low (coming from harcore gamer)
    - Not sure if need to address right now

V1

- What are the crystals for? How can they be used in the game?
    - Missed opportunity, there might be some interesting gameplay element here

# VISUAL ISSUES

- Would be nicer if the shards were more attractive to collect

- What else could the environment be other than space? (more originality)

- Character is not cute

- Would like to see more life in character (animation, reactivity to environment, etc)

# OTHER

- Feels similar to RASHLANDER, Dark Void, Ikachan
