# GAMEPLAY ISSUES

- Too difficult, keeps going out of safe area (v3)
    - Can probably eliminate by only having closed space levels
    - Also, level 1 should be way more easier

- Immediately crashed (v2)
    - Too difficult for children, controls are too sensitive, v3 increased leniency on collisions but, re-thinking the gameplay to go further

- Pressed abort button quickly (v2) (too prominent)
    - Somewhat solved in v3, but can probably just remove the restart screen entirely

- What are the crystals for? How can they be used in the game?
    - Missed opportunity, there might be some interesting gameplay element here

- Hard to imagine how to see repleatability
    - Good point, needs thinking but a bit later once core mechanic is more solid

- Skill ceiling feels a bit low (coming from harcore gamer)
    - Not sure if need to address right now

# VISUAL ISSUES

- Would be nicer if the shards were more attractive to collect

- What else could the environment be other than space? (more originality)

- Character is not cute

- Would like to see more life in character (animation, reactivity to environment, etc)

# OTHER

- Feels similar to RASHLANDER, Dark Void, Ikachan
